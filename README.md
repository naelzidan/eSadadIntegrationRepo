ServiceTypeCode (Characters, Numbers, Symbols), ServiceNameArabic, ServiceNameEnglish , PaymentType (PostPaid, PrePaid), Currency ( JOD,USD,ILS), BankCode (Integer), IBAN, PartialPayment (True, False), LowerValue , UpperValue 
o	Create Tabke (Config File) for Digital Signature Certificates 
CertificateOwner(Esadad, Biller Name), CertificateType (Public, Private), CertificatePassword, CertficiatePath
o	Handle decimal Places appropriate for currencies (JOD:3, USD:2, ILS:2)
o	Create Log tables 
-	EsadadTransactionsLogs (Id, Transaction type (Request, Response), API (BillPull, PrepaidValidation, ReceivePaymentNotification), Guid, Billing Number, Bill Number, Service type, Currency, XmlElement, Insert date time) // include any other fields as necessary.
-	EsadadPaymetsLogs (Id, Guid, BillingNumber, BillNumber, ServiceType, Currency, PaidAmount, IsPaid (True, False)) // include any other fields as necessary.
